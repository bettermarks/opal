"""
(From ChatGPT): The unit of work pattern is a design pattern used to manage
transactions in software applications that interact with a database. The
basic idea behind the pattern is to group a set of related database operations
into a single "unit of work" that can be executed as a single transaction.

This file implements the 'unit of work' pattern in an abstract
class "TransactionManager". Concrete implementations of that interface
could use for example
- PostgreSQL and
- SqlAlchemy

The implementation of this unit of work class is taken from
